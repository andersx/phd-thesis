\chapter{Mass-spectroscopy in protein structure determination}

This section introduces the two experimental methods, hydrogen exchange mass spectroscopy (HXMS) and cross-correlation mass spectroscopy (XCMS), and possible application in protein folding.

These experimental methods are attractive, since the experiments are relatively easy to carry out.

XLMS has previously been used to 

We considered several linkers of different lengths. The \textit{de facto} standard linkers, DSS and DST which measure 11 \aa ngstr\"o m and 6.4 \aa ngstr\"o m, respectively.
